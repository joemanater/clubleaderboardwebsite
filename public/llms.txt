# ClubLeaderboard

> ClubLeaderboard is an independent golf club ranking and comparison site. It ranks 151+ clubs across 6 categories (drivers, irons, wedges, putters, hybrids, fairway woods) using a weighted scoring system with no manufacturer sponsorship or pay-to-play advertising. All scores are editorial. Data is current as of 2026.

## Key Field Definitions

- **Overall Score** (0-10, 1 decimal): Weighted average of category-specific performance metrics. Each club type uses different weights (e.g., drivers weight Forgiveness 25%, Distance 25%, Feel & Sound 20%, Adjustability 15%, Value 15%). Higher is better.
- **Price (MSRP)**: Manufacturer's suggested retail price in USD. Iron prices are per set (typically 7 clubs). All other categories are per club. Previous-generation clubs may show a discounted street price alongside the original MSRP.
- **Value Score** (0-10): Editorial assessment of performance relative to price. Weighted at 15% of the overall score across all categories.
- **Year**: Model year of the club. The database includes clubs from 2021-2026.
