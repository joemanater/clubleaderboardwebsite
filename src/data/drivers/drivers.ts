      'The PXG Lightning Tour Mid delivers a compelling blend of game-improvement forgiveness and tour-level distance at a surprisingly accessible $399 price point.

Back and perimeter weighting push the MOI to 9400 for enhanced stability, while the high-loft configuration makes it easy to launch the ball high for more carry distance. At $399, it brings genuine max-forgiveness performance to golfers who cannot justify flagship pricing.',
